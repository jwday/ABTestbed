# Air Bearing Platform CAD Model
Air bearing platform CAD files (entirely in .SLDPRT and .SLDASM as of 11/12/2020) for public use. Includes CAD model of propulsion system mounted on the top of the platform.

The platform is constructed with a combination of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components largely from the paintball industry and 3D printed brackets, etc. SolidWorks files are provided and *should* be linked by relative filepaths to facilitate transfer from source without breaking any part file links.

The printed circuit board (PCB) which controlled the propulsion system also relayed pressure data to the remote user. This makes the platform inextricably linked to the propulsion system unless a replacement analog pressure gauge is used for the platform. I will provide alternate configurations sans propulsion system to illustrate different means of operating the platform without the need for the propulsion system PCB.

## Future Updates
- Comprehensive list of components and their suppliers
- Cost beakdown
- STL files for 3D printed components
- Recommended print settings

The platform is constructed with a combination of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components largely from the paintball industry and 3D printed brackets, etc. SolidWorks files are provided and *should* be linked by relative filepaths to facilitate transfer from source without breaking any part file links.

## Future Updates
- Comprehensive list of components and their suppliers
- Cost beakdown
- STL files for 3D printed components
- Recommended print settings
